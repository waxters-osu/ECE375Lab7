= About

A rock-paper-scissors game for two AVR ATMega32U4 boards. The program is 
written in assembly, for the term project of OSU's _Computer Organization and 
Assembly_ class. The program is designed using a finite state machine where
both the local and remote (other player's) game state is tracked independently.
State transitions occur based on user input, remote game state, and timeouts.
Communication between devices is via a UART connection. See the video below for
a demonstration and explanation.
